This is an updated and expanded version of the lecture notes
"Mathematics of Random Events" written in collaboration with Nikolaos
Constantinou in 2020. Those notes were largely based on material typeset
by Nikolaos Constantinou as a student, when the ST342 module was taught
by Wei Wu in the Autumn 2019 term at Warwick. The module taught by Wei
Wu was largely based on handwritten lecture notes received from Larbi
Alili, which in turn were based on material previously developed by
Sigurd Assing, Anastasia Papavasileiou, Jon Warren and Wilfrid Kendall.
