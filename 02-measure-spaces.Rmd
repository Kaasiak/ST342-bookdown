# Measure Spaces

The goal in this chapter is to define the notion of a measure space
$(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ and work on examples to get familiar with
the relevant concepts.

Later on, we will focus our attention on two types of measures: the
Lebesgue measure $m$ and probability measures $\mathbb{P}$.

## Classes of sets {#sub:algebras}

This may be the least pleasant topic, but we *need* to go through it.

### $\sigma$-algebras

We start with the notion of $\sigma$-algebra on a sample space $\Omega$.

:::{.definition}
**($\sigma$-algebra)**. Let $\Omega$ be a sample space. A collection $\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of
$\Omega$ is called a *$\sigma$-algebra* (or $\sigma$-field) on $\Omega$, if

1.  $\Omega \in \mathcal{F}$,

2.  $A \in \mathcal{F} \implies A^c \in \mathcal{F}$,

3.  $A_1, A_2,\dots \in \mathcal{F} \implies \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i \in \mathcal{F}$.

The pair $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$ is called a *measurable space*. The
sets $A \in \mathcal{F}$ are called *$\mathcal{F}$-measurable sets*, or
*measurable sets* when $\mathcal{F}$ is clear from the context.
:::

In this case, it also satisfies

4.  $\emptyset \in \mathcal{F}$,

5.  $A_1, A_2,\dots \in \mathcal{F} \implies \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty}A_i \in \mathcal{F}$.

Let us review the following examples to build our intuition.

:::{.example}
For a given sample space $\Omega$, let
$\mathcal{P}(\Omega) := \{A: A \subseteq \Omega\}$ be the power set of
$\Omega$. Then $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$.
:::

:::{.example}
For a given sample space $\Omega$, let
$\mathcal{A} = \{\emptyset, \Omega\}$. Then $\mathcal{A}$ defines a
$\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$, and it is called the *trivial
$\sigma$-algebra*.
:::

:::{.exercise}
Let $\Omega$ be a set and $\mathcal{A}$ the class of all subsets which
are either countable or whose complement is countable. Prove that
$\mathcal{A}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra.
:::

:::{.exercise}
Let $\mathcal{A}_1$ and $\mathcal{A}_2$ be $\sigma$-algebras on a given
sample space $\Omega$, and let
$\mathcal{A}= \mathcal{A}_1 \cap \mathcal{A}_2$ be the class made of the
sets that belong to both $\mathcal{A}_1$ and $\mathcal{A}_2$. Prove that
$\mathcal{A}:= \mathcal{A}_1 \cap \mathcal{A}_2$ is also a
$\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega$.
:::

:::{.exercise #pullback name="Pull-back"}
If $f : \Omega_1 \to \Omega_2$ and $\mathcal{F}_2$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on
$\Omega_2$, prove that
$f^{-1}(\mathcal{F}_2) := \{ f^{-1}(A): A \in \mathcal{F}_2 \}$ is a
$\sigma$-algebra on $\Omega_1$.
:::

So when a function goes from a sample space $\Omega_1$ to another space
$\Omega_2$, it pulls back any $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ on
$\Omega_2$ to a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$ on $\Omega_1$, as in the
following diagram:
