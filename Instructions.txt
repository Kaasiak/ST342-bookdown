## Dummy subsection {#sub:dummy}

This is a dummy equation

This section is to show how we cen refer to other sections and theorems. 

Referencing the Theorems, exmalpes and equations is done by using their labels
It is enough to enter `\@ref(label)` e.g.:

- Theorem \@ref(thm:seriesfubini) is a very important one.
- Don't forget to solve Example \@ref(exm:vitali) before the exam.
- Equation \@ref(eq:series) can be quite tricky.

To reference a section by its number we can do it the same way with `\@ref(label)`, e.g.:

- In Section \@ref(sub:eventsinfty) we introduce the topic of ...

To reference a section by its title we can do this by witting the section 
header in square brackets `[Section name]`, e.g.:

- In Section [Events at infinity] we introduce the topic of ...

Cross-references still work even when we refer to an item that is not on the 
current page of the HTML output.

We can link to the elements from the References (Bibliography) using their keys: 
`@key` gives the author and the year in brackets, use `[@key]` for both the 
author and the year in brackets, e.g.:

- See @Cohn13 for more details
- See [@Cohn13] for more details
