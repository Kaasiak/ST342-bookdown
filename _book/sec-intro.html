<p>Can we toss a coin infinitely many times?</p>
<p>Why is countable additivity important?</p>
<p>We know that <span class="math inline">\(\E[X+Y]=\E[X] + \E[Y]\)</span>, but why? It doesn’t seem to follow
from the usual definition that treats discrete and continuous random
variables as hermetically separated entities. So, what is expectation,
really?</p>
<p>Do continuous random variables even exist?</p>
<p>How small can a class <span class="math inline">\(\cA\)</span> of events be so that their probabilities
determine <span class="math inline">\(\Pb\)</span>?</p>
<p>Why can we differentiate moment generating functions to compute moments?</p>
<p>Our aim is to study concepts of Measure Theory useful to Probability
Theory, providing a solid ground for the latter. A <em>measure</em> generalises
the notion of area for arbitrary sets in Euclidean spaces
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^d\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d \geq 1\)</span>. We introduce the theory of measurable
spaces, measurable functions, integral with respect to a measure,
density of measures, product measures, and convergence of functions and
random variables.</p>
<p>Below we give examples that motivate the need for such a theory, discuss
in which sense modern Measure Theory is the best we can hope for, and
introduce the concept of infinite numbers and infinite sums used
throughout the remaining chapters.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Events at infinity</h2>
<p>We know that <span class="math inline">\(A_n \uparrow A\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(\Pb(A_n) \uparrow \Pb(A)\)</span> which,
assuming that <span class="math inline">\(\Pb\)</span> is non-negative and finitely additive, is equivalent
to <span class="math inline">\(\Pb\)</span> being <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-additive (a shorthand for countably additive).
Below we see examples where interesting models and events require some
sort of limiting process in their study.</p>

the event <span class="math inline">\(A = \{(x_1, \dots, x_N): x_1 = 1, x_5 = 0\}\)</span>. Rigorously,

<div id="sub:measureproblem" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The measure problem</h2>
<p>It is clear (it should be!) from previous examples that we want to work
with measures that have nice <em>continuity</em> properties, so we can take
limits. However, when the mass is spread over uncountably many sample
points <span class="math inline">\(\omega \in \Omega\)</span>, it is not possible to assign a measure to
all subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> in a reasonable way.</p>
<p>We would like to define a random variable uniformly distributed on
<span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>, by means of a function that assigns a weight to subsets of this
interval. For instance, what is the probability that this number is
irrational? What is the probability that its decimal expansion does not
contain a 3?</p>
<p>This is the same problem as assigning a ‘length’ to subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\R\)</span>. We
are also interested in defining a measure of ‘area’ on <span class="math inline">\(\R^2\)</span>, ‘volume’
on <span class="math inline">\(\R^3\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, a good measure of length/area/volume/etc. on <span class="math inline">\(\R^d\)</span> should:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>give the correct value on obvious sets, such as intervals and balls;</p></li>
<li><p>give the same value if we rotate or translate a set;</p></li>
<li><p>be <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-additive.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We stress again that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-additivity is equivalent to a measure being
continuous, and we are not willing to resign that. On the other hand, we
do not want more than that: each of the uncountably many points in
<span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> alone has length zero, but all together they have length one;
likewise, each sequence of coin tosses in <span class="math inline">\(\{0,1\}^\N\)</span> has probability
zero, but all together they have probability one.</p>
<p>The measure problem is the following.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no measure <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> defined on all subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\R^d\)</span> which satisfy
all the reasonable properties listed above. What modern Measure Theory
does is to work with measures that are defined on a class of sets which
is large enough to be useful and small enough for these properties to
hold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next example shows that there is no measure <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> defined on all
subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\R^3\)</span> which satisfies these three properties.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:banachtarski" class="example"><strong>Example 1.7  (Banach-Tarski paradox) </strong></span>Consider the ball <span class="math display">\[B = \{x \in \R^3 : \|x\| \leq 1 \} .\]</span> There exist<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
<span class="math inline">\(k\in\N\)</span>, <em>disjoint</em> sets <span class="math inline">\(A_1,\dots,A_{2k}\)</span>, and <em>isometries</em> (maps
that preserve distances and angles) <span class="math inline">\(S_1,\dots,S_{2k}:\R^3\to\R^3\)</span> such
that
<span class="math display">\[B = (A_1 \cup \dots \cup A_k) \cup (A_{k+1} \cup \dots \cup A_{2k}),\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[B = S_1 A_1 \cup \dots \cup S_{k} A_{k}, \quad B = S_{k+1} A_{k+1} \cup \dots \cup S_{2k} A_{2k}.\]</span>
So <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> was decomposed into <em>finitely many</em> pieces, which were later on
moved around <em>rigidly</em> and <em>recombined</em> to produce two copies of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>!
Why is it a paradox? Finitely many pieces is not the issue in itself,
since <span class="math inline">\(\N\)</span> can be decomposed into even and odd numbers, and they can be
<em>compressed</em> (or stretched, in some sense) to produce two copies of
<span class="math inline">\(\N\)</span>. Rigidity alone is not the issue either, since we can move each of
the <em>uncountably many</em> points of the segment <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> to form the segment
<span class="math inline">\([0,2]\)</span>. The paradox is that this magic was done with <em>rigid movements
on finitely many pieces</em>. And here we can see the <em>measure problem</em>: if
all these disjoint sets <span class="math inline">\(A_1,\dots,A_{2k}\)</span> were to have a volume
<span class="math inline">\(V_1,\dots,V_{2k} \geq 0\)</span>, what would be the volume of the ball <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>?</p>
</div>
<p>The next example is not nearly as effective in impressing friends at a
party, and would certainly not make a youtube video with 31 million
views, but it has two advantages. First, it shows directly that the
measure problem already occurs on <span class="math inline">\(d=1\)</span>. Second, we can actually explain
its proof in a third of a page rather than a dozen.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><span id="exm:vitali" class="example"><strong>Example 1.8  (Vitali Set) </strong></span>Consider the unit circle <span class="math inline">\(\SSS^1\)</span> with points indexed by turns instead of degrees or radians.
This is the same as the interval <span class="math inline">\(\SSS^1 = [0,1)\)</span> with the angle
addition operation <span class="math inline">\(x \oplus y = x+y \mod 1\)</span>. There exists a set
<span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq [0,1)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\SSS^1\)</span> is decomposed into disjoint
<span class="math inline">\(\{E_n\}_{n\in\N}\)</span> which are translations of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. And here we see again
the <em>measure problem</em>: by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-additivity, if the length of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is
zero, then the length of the circle is zero; and if the length of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is
non-zero, then the length of the circle is infinite. So <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is not
measurable.</p>
</div>
<div class="proof">
<p><span id="unlabeled-div-7" class="proof"><em>Proof</em>. </span><em>(Sketch)</em> Write <span class="math inline">\(\Q \cap [0,1) = \{r_n\}_{n=1,2,3,\dots}\)</span>. For
<span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq \SSS^1\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(E_n = \{ x \oplus r_n : x \in E \}\)</span> be the
<em>translation</em> of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span>. We want to find a set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> such that</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The sets <span class="math inline">\(E_1,E_2,E_3,\dots\)</span> are disjoint,</p></li>
<li><p>The union satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\cup_n E_n = \SSS^1\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Start with a small set that satisfies the first property, such as
<span class="math inline">\(E = \{0\}\)</span>. Enlarge the set <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> by adding a point
<span class="math inline">\(x \in \SSS^1 \setminus (\cup_n E_n)\)</span>. Adding such point does not break
the first property (proof omitted), and may help the second one. Keep
adding points this way, until it is no longer possible. When it is no
longer possible, it can only be so because the second property is also
satisfied.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div class="remark">
<p><span id="unlabeled-div-8" class="remark"><em>Remark</em>. </span>It is often emphasised that the Banach-Tarski paradox and Vitali set
depend crucially on the Axiom of Choice (for the above sketch of proof,
it is concealed in the expression “keep adding until”). We may wonder
what happens if we do not accept this axiom. In this case, we cannot
prove the Banach-Tarski paradox, nor the existence of a Vitali set. But
neither can we prove that they do not exist, so the measure problem
persists.</p>

</div>
<div id="sub:infinitenumbers" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Infinite numbers and infinite sums</h2>
<p>We now define the set of extended real numbers and briefly discuss some
its useful properties, then discuss the meaning of infinite sums, and
move on to other perhaps philosophical questions about this theory.</p>
<div id="subsub:extended" class="section level3" number="1.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Extended real numbers</h3>
<p>We are about to start working with measures, and because measures can be
infinite, and integrals can be negative infinite, we work with the set
of <em>extended real numbers</em> <span class="math inline">\(\oR := [-\infty,+\infty]\)</span> that extends <span class="math inline">\(\R\)</span>
by adding two symbols <span class="math inline">\(\pm \infty\)</span>. The novelty is of course to
conveniently allow operations and comparisons involving these symbols.</p>
<p>Basically, we can safely operate as one would reasonably guess:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{gathered}
-\infty &lt; -1 &lt; 0 &lt; 5 &lt; +\infty,
\
-7 +\infty = +\infty,
\
(-2) \times (-\infty) = +\infty,
\\
|-\infty| = +\infty,
\
(+\infty) \times (-\infty) = -\infty,
\
a \leq b \implies a+x \leq b+x
\\
\lim_{n\to\infty} (2+n^2)
=
\lim_{n\to\infty} 2
+
\lim_{n\to\infty} n^2
=
2 + \infty
=
+\infty,\end{gathered}\]</span> etc. Since we will never need to divide by
infinity, let us leave <span class="math inline">\(\frac{x}{\infty}\)</span> undefined (otherwise we would
need to check that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is finite).</p>
<p>The non-obvious definition is <span class="math inline">\(0 \cdot \infty = 0\)</span>. In Calculus, it
would have been considered an indeterminate form, but in Measure Theory
it is convenient to define it this way because the integral of a
function that takes value <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> on an interval of infinite length and
<span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span> at a few points should still be <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. That is, the area of a
rectangle having zero width and infinite length is zero.</p>
<p>Now some caveats. First, <span class="math inline">\(\lim_n (a_n b_n) = (\lim_n a_n)(\lim_n b_n)\)</span>
may fail in case it gives <span class="math inline">\(0 \cdot \infty\)</span>. Also, note that now
<span class="math inline">\(a+b = a+c\)</span> does not imply <span class="math inline">\(b=c\)</span>. This can be false when <span class="math inline">\(a=\pm \infty\)</span>.
Likewise, <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;b\)</span> no longer implies that <span class="math inline">\(a+x &lt; b+x\)</span>. So we should be
careful with cancellations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one thing that is definitely not allowed, and that Measure Theory
does not handle well, is <span class="math display">\[\text{&quot; $ +\infty -\infty $ &quot; !}\]</span> This is
simply forbidden, and if we will ever write this, it will be in

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Infinite sums</h3>
<p>Infinite sums of numbers on <span class="math inline">\([0,+\infty]\)</span> are always well-defined
through a rather simple formula. If <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> is an index set and
<span class="math inline">\(x_\alpha \in [0,+\infty]\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \in \Lambda\)</span>, we define:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\nonumber
\sum_{\alpha \in \Lambda} x_\alpha = \sup_{\stackrel{A \subseteq \Lambda}{A \text{ finite}}} \sum_{\alpha \in A} x_\alpha
.\]</span> The set <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> can be uncountable, but the sum can be finite only
if <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_+ = \{\alpha:x_\alpha&gt;0\}\)</span> is countable (proof omitted). If
<span class="math inline">\(x_\alpha \in [-\infty,+\infty]\)</span>, we define
<span class="math inline">\(\Lambda_- = \{\alpha:x_\alpha&lt;0\}\)</span> and
<span class="math display" id="eq:infsum">\[\begin{equation}
\sum_{\alpha \in \Lambda} x_\alpha =
\sup_{\stackrel{A \subseteq \Lambda_+}{A \text{ finite}}} \sum_{\alpha \in A} x_\alpha
\
-
\
\sup_{\stackrel{A \subseteq \Lambda_-}{A \text{ finite}}} \sum_{\alpha \in A} -x_\alpha
,
\tag{1.1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
as long as this difference does not give “<span class="math inline">\(+\infty-\infty\)</span>” !</p>
<p>The theory of conditionally convergent sums as
<span class="math display" id="eq:series">\[\begin{equation}
\sum_{j \in \N} x_j
=
\lim_n
\sum_{j = 1}^n x_j
\tag{1.2}
\end{equation}\]</span>
is hardly meaningful to us. In case the expression
in <a href="sec-intro.html#eq:infsum">(1.1)</a> is well-defined, we can write
<span class="math inline">\((\Lambda_- \cup \Lambda_+) = \{\alpha_j\}_{j\in\N}\)</span> by ordering these
indices in any way we want (assuming for simplicity that these sets are
countable), and formula <a href="sec-intro.html#eq:series">(1.2)</a> will give the same result
as <a href="sec-intro.html#eq:infsum">(1.1)</a>. Pretty robust.</p>
<p>However, in case <a href="sec-intro.html#eq:series">(1.2)</a> converges
but <a href="sec-intro.html#eq:infsum">(1.1)</a> is not well-defined (so it gives
“<span class="math inline">\(+\infty-\infty\)</span>”), we can re-order the index set <span class="math inline">\(\N\)</span> so
that <a href="sec-intro.html#eq:series">(1.2)</a> will give any number we want. This is definitely
not the type of delicacy we want to handle here.</p>
<p>For this reason, we will only
use <a href="sec-intro.html#eq:series">(1.2)</a> when either <span class="math display">\[x_j \in [0,+\infty]\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>,
or when <span class="math display">\[\sum_j |x_j| &lt; \infty .\]</span> So there are two overlapping cases
where we can work comfortably: non-negative extended numbers, or series
which are absolutely summable.</p>

<div id="two-different-and-overlapping-theories" class="section level3" number="1.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.3</span> Two different and overlapping theories</h3>
<p>The above tradeoff is already a good prelude to something rather deep
that will appear constantly in upcoming chapters. Borrowing
from <span class="citation">[@Tao11]</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because of this tradeoff, we will see two overlapping types of measure
and integration theory: the <em>non-negative</em> theory, which involves
quantities taking values in <span class="math inline">\([0, +\infty]\)</span>, and the <em>absolutely
integrable</em> theory, which involves quantities taking values in <span class="math inline">\(\R\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(\C\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, at the risk of leaving it for the reader to figure out some
corner cases, we can (and will) extend these theories to a theory on
<span class="math inline">\([-\infty,+\infty]\)</span> by doing what we just did above. Namely, whereas the
absolutely integrable theory requires that both terms
in <a href="sec-intro.html#eq:infsum">(1.1)</a> be finite, and the non-negative theory requires
that one of them be zero, we only require that one of them be finite.</p>
<p>We end this chapter with the simplest example of these overlapping
theories</p>

<span class="math inline">\(\sum_{A}x_{j,k} \leq \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n x_{j,k}\)</span>. Conversely,

<span class="math inline">\(\sum_{A} x_{j,k} = \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n x_{j,k}\)</span>. Therefore,
